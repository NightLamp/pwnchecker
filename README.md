This program checks if your passwords have been leaked using the data from "Have I Been Pwned".

It is planned to be run daily and on startup, but idk how it will notify users yet.

It will store your passwords in a hash on your hard drive unless someone tells me this is bad practice.


please note that I'm only a student and I can't guarantee this is safe at all - I'm in way over my head.
