# Pwncheck

This program checks if your passwords have been leaked using the data from "Have I Been Pwned".
It is planned to be run daily and on startup, but idk how it will notify users yet. It was inspired 
by the "Have You Been Pwned - Computerphile" youtube video.

It stores your passwords in a hash on your hard drive unless someone tells me this is bad practice.
You can also use it to check a password without storing it


please note that I'm only a student and I can't guarantee this is safe at all - I'm in way over my head.
